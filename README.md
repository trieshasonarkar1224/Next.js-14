  Seeding the database with initial data using a provided script and troubleshooting common issues.
  <br>
  Exploring the database through the Vercel dashboard and running SQL queries to verify data.

<

Chapter Seven - Fetching Data
<br>


  Discusses different methods for fetching data, such as APIs, server components, and SQL.
  <br>
  Emphasizes the importance of securing database queries by avoiding client-side exposure.
  <br>
  Explains how to create API endpoints in Next.js and interact with databases using SQL or 
  ORM.
  <br>
without additional API layers

Chapter Eight - Static and Dynamic Rendering
<br>


  Discusses the advantages of using React server components for asynchronous data fetching.
  <br>
  Explains the versatility and industry standard of SQL for database queries.
  <br>
  Shows how the Vercel Postgres SDK protects against SQL injections.
  <br>
  
  Chapter Nine - Streaming

  
  Discusses the advantages of using React server components for asynchronous data fetching.
  <br>
  Explains the versatility and industry standard of SQL for database queries.
  <br>
  Shows how the Vercel Postgres SDK protects against SQL injections.
  <br>


Chapter Ten - Partial Prerendering (Optional)


  Walks through fetching data for various components like the dashboard, revenue chart, and latest invoices.
  <br>
  Discusses the use of async components and how to handle fetched data in Next.js.
  <br>
  Demonstrates importing and using data fetching functions in components.
  <br>
  Highlights the importance of proper data fetching to avoid application errors.
  <br>

Chapter Eleven - Adding Search and Pagination


  The instructor introduces Chapter Eleven, focusing on adding search and pagination functionalities to the dashboard. They explain the use of Next.js APIs like `useSearchParams` and `useRouter` for managing search states and URL updates.
  <br>
  Code is pasted into the invoices page, and the instructor explains that search allows for specific invoice searches while pagination navigates between pages. The URL is updated with search parameters, and data is fetched on the server.
  <br>
  The instructor discusses the benefits of using URL search parameters, such as bookmarkable URLs and server-side rendering. They highlight three Next.js client hooks for implementing search: `useSearchParams`, `usePathname`, and `useRouter`.
  <br>
  Steps to implement search are explained, including capturing user input, updating the URL, and keeping the URL in sync with the input field. The instructor walks through adding an `onChange` event listener to the search input.

  <br>


Chapter Twelve - Mutating Data


  The instructor demonstrates logging the search term in the console and highlights how user input updates the URL. They import `useSearchParams` from Next.js navigation and create a new URL search parameters instance.
  <br>
  The instructor explains creating a page URL using `useRouter` and `usePathname`, ensuring the URL is updated without reloading the page. They emphasize keeping the URL and input in sync with default values.
  <br>
  Pagination is introduced, and the instructor explains updating the table component to reflect the search query. They navigate to the invoices page to implement these updates and ensure the table component receives the current search parameters.
  <br>
  Debouncing is introduced to optimize search functionality, preventing new database queries on every keystroke. The instructor imports the `useDebounce` library and updates the search component to use debouncing.
<br>

Chapter Thirteen - Handling Errors
<br>


  The speaker introduces the concept of handling errors gracefully using JavaScript try-catch statements and Next.js APIs.
